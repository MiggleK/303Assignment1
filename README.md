Instructions: Code is based off the text file "numfile.txt" included in the respository.
The code accepts only int input. There are small adjustments to make sure correct input is made, but it is not in depth and thus
will not stop any major attempt to break the program. If the file cannot be opened, the program will alert the user.

I added a "printArray" function to allow the user to see the modifications to the array in real time.
